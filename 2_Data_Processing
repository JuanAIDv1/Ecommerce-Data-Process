Data Processing Module

This folder contains all processed datasets and reference mapping files
used as input for the Power BI dashboard.

Description
The Excel files in this module are generated or maintained as part of
the data preparation process.

Scraping scripts generate the core datasets, while mapping files (MAPs)
are used to standardize and harmonize business criteria across the data.

Data Flow
1. Web scraping extracts raw e-commerce data
2. Data is consolidated into analytical matrices
3. Mapping files are applied to unify categories, regions and channels
4. Final datasets are consumed by the BI dashboard

Output Files
- Sales and product analytical matrices
- Mapping reference files (MAPs) for data homogenization
